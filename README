Steps to execute:
Clone the project by using git command to any folder
git clone https://github.com/silpareddyb/AutomationTest.git
wait for a while to download all dependencies to import

FRAMEWORK : I have used cucumber with serenity flavour to get proper test results.(@Step annotation marks this as a method that will be recorded and will appear in the test report)

For Execution: On mac
install chromedriver in default path by
brew install chromedriver
Run the maven command or run CucumberRunner class in the project
mvn clean verify

For Execution: On Windows
download latest chromedriver and install in the system
Run the maven command : mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.chrome.WebDriver = ""/path to chromedriver/.chromedriver.exe"

TEST REPORT : Find the test results with screenshots in the folder : target/site/serenity/index.html

NOTE: chrome version used 71.0

IMPROVEMENTS:
1.Can able to do more reusable methods and data can be passed through external file.
2.I can able to send account details as "DataTable" (using collection extract values)
3. I have few other scenarios to cover but due to lack of time I have done only happy path scenarios.
